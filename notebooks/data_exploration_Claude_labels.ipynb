Fascist movements in Africa have historically drawn inspiration from European fascist ideologies, such as Benito Mussolini's Italy and Adolf Hitler's Germany. Some examples of fascist regimes in Africa include those of Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. It is important to note that while elements of fascism have appeared in African politics, the context and dynamics of these regimes may differ from classical examples in Europe.   \n",

Anarchism is more of a set of principles and values that aim to create a more just and equitable society based on voluntary cooperation, mutual aid, and the rejection of hierarchy and authority. It envisions a society where power is decentralized, and individuals have the autonomy to govern themselves without coercion.\\n\\nAnarchists believe in self-organization, direct democracy, and community decision-making. They advocate for the abolition of oppressive institutions like the state, capitalism, and other forms of domination. While there isn't a single unified vision of how an anarchist society would look like, proponents argue that communities should be able to organize themselves in a way that best suits their needs   \n",

Authoritarianism, on the other hand, refers to a system of government characterized by strong central power and limited political freedoms. In practice, authoritarian regimes may hold elections, but these elections are often not free or fair and primarily serve to legitimize the existing ruling party or leader rather than truly represent the will of the people. In essence, the combination of authoritarianism and democracy is contradictory, as true democracy requires a respect for civil liberties and political pluralism that authoritarian systems typically do not uphold.   \n",
